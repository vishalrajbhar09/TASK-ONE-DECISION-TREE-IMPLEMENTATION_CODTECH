Task Overview: Decision Tree Classifier
📝 Introduction
This task focuses on implementing a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset. The objective is to train a machine learning model that can classify flowers into different species based on their characteristics. The decision tree structure provides an interpretable approach to understanding how the model makes predictions.

🎯 Task Objectives
✔️ Train a Decision Tree model to classify flower species.
✔️ Evaluate the model using accuracy score and classification report.
✔️ Visualize the Decision Tree structure for better interpretability.
✔️ Display the decision rules used in classification.

📊 Dataset Used
Dataset: Iris dataset (built-in Scikit-Learn dataset).

Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.

Target Classes: list of flowers


🔍 Task Workflow
1️⃣ Load Dataset – Import the Iris dataset or any custom dataset.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Prepare the data for model training.
3️⃣ Train Model – Use a Decision Tree Classifier to fit the data.
4️⃣ Model Evaluation – Assess model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.
5️⃣ Visualization – Generate a Decision Tree graph and extract decision rules.
